# Hotel Management System - PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Full-stack hotel management system (CRM) + Public hotel website with online booking engine. CRM for internal management, Website for guest-facing reservations. Both share the same database but are architecturally separate.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI (server.py ~8.1k lines + public_routes.py for website APIs)
- **Frontend**: React (App.js CRM ~15k lines + Website.js public site ~700 lines)
- **Database**: MongoDB (shared between CRM and Website)
- **Auth**: JWT-based for CRM; Public APIs for website (no auth)
- **Routing**: `/website` → Public hotel website, `/dashboard` → CRM (auth required)

## What's Been Implemented

### CRM Features (Complete)
- Authentication, Dashboard, Room/Booking/Guest Management
- Restaurant POS, Stock Management, Payroll
- Income/Expense tracking with dynamic categories, vendor management
- Calendar view, Financial reports (daily/monthly), Role-based access
- Channel management, PDF ID proof uploads, 5-min room hold mechanism

### Public Hotel Website (NEW - Oct 2026)
1. **One-Page Design**: Hero slider, Rooms, Booking Engine, Amenities, Gallery, About, Contact, Footer
2. **Real-Time Booking Engine**: Checks CRM room availability → Guest details → PayHere payment
3. **5-Minute Room Hold**: Concurrent booking protection with countdown timer
4. **PayHere Payment Gateway**: Sandbox mode integrated, hash generation, server notification webhook
5. **Payment Options**: Full payment (100%) or Advance (30% minimum)
6. **Cloudflare Turnstile**: Bot protection on contact form (Site Key configured)
7. **SMS/Email Confirmations**: Uses CRM settings (notify.lk + Brevo) on booking confirmation
8. **Idempotency Guard**: PayHere notification handler prevents duplicate bookings on retries
